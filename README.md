## Terminology

| Term      | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AccessKey | Gives access to the ODIN network for a customer. It is a 44 character long Base64-String, which consists of a version, random bytes and a checksum. |
| SecretKey | Generated from the AccessKey, it is based on the Ed25519-Curve and used to sign a Token generated by the customer.                                  |
| PublicKey | Generated from the AccessKey, it is based on the Ed25519-Curve and must be uploaded to 4Players so that a generated Token can be verified.          |
| KeyId     | A shortened PublicKey, included in Token, making it possible to identify what PublicKey must be used to verify the Token.                           |
| Token     | A [JWT] given to the game clients that allows them to connect to a voice/video chat room in the ODIN network.                                       |
